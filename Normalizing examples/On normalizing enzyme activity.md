# On normalizing enzyme activity
After producing these 2 figures, I've concluded that when I'm comparing k2, concentration of enzymes, and Km, I should first normalize all 3 of them before conducting any statistical comparisons. Normalizing, in this case, means dividing these 3 quantities by the litter mass.

## Normalizing 1 sample
Let's examine the figure where I normalize only 1 sample. I set the same axis limits for all the plots in this figure. The top middle plot is the one where I normalized enzyme activity and plotted that versus substrate concentration. The top right plot is the one where I normalized k2 and used this normalized k2 to calculate new enzyme activity. As you can see, these plots look identical in shape. So, you can conclude that by plotting normalized enzyme activity vs substrate concentration, that has the effect of normalizing k2 first and then using this normalized k2 to calculate enzyme activity. While k2 normally has units of s^-1 or other inverse units of time, by normalizing k2, this new k2 has units of s^-1 g^-1. So the "k2" in the top middle and top right plots is ***normalized*** k2. The substrate and enzyme concentrations and the Michaelis-Menten constant are not normalized.

Now, onto the plots at the bottom of the same figure. Bottom left (Kiara reference, anyone?) plot is made by normalizing both enzyme activity and substrate concentration and then plotting that against each other. Bottom middle plot is made by normalizing (1) substrate concentrations, (2) enzyme concentration, and (3) the Michaelis-Menten constant and then using these normalized values to calculate normalized enzyme activity. k2 is not normalized. As you can see, both of these 2 plots are identical. By plotting normalizing both enzyme activity and substrate concentrations and plotting them against each other, you have the effect of normalizing the above 3 values and using them to calculate the normalized enzyme activity.

Now, I would like to note that whether I normalize (1) k2 or (2) substrate & enzyme concentrations and the Michaelis-Menten constant, I still produce the same normalized enzyme activity rates. To see if this is true, I plotted normalized enzyme activity calculated by normalizing k2 against normalized enzyme activity calculated by normalizing (1) substrate concentrations, (2) enzyme concentration, and (3) the Michaelis-Menten constant in the bottom right plot. As you can see it's a perfect correlation. They are identical. However, normalizing one or the other results in different substrate concentrations, which would lengthen or shorten either of the other curves.

## Normalizing 3 samples
Now, let's examine the figure where I normalize 3 samples. Each row in the figure represents a different sample, with sample 1 (top row) having the highest litter mass and sample 3 (bottom row) having the lowest litter mass. The left column are plots of their total enzyme activity; the middle column consist of plots of their normalized enzyme activity vs substrate concentration; the right column consists of plots of normalized enzyme activity vs normalized substrate concentrations. I made it so that all 3 samples have identical **total** enzyme activity, but because their litter masses are different, they will end up with different **normalized** enzyme activity. Because their **total** enzyme activities are identical, they all have identical (1) k2, (2) enzyme concentration, and (3) Michaelis-Menten constants. Conversely, because their **normalized** enzyme activities are different, their normalized versions of (1) k2, (2) enzyme concentrations, and (3) Michaelis-Menten constants will be different between samples.

As stated in the above section, by plotting normalized enzyme activity vs substrate concentration, you have the effect of first normalizing k2 and then using that normalized k2 to calculate enzyme activity. If you look in the middle column, notice how, as you go down the column, normalized enzyme activities tend to increase. That is because litter mass decreases as you go down the column. So, you can conclude that **normalized** k2 tends to increase as you go down. This is much more valuable information than k2 for total enzyme activity. If we only look at the left column, we would assume that they all have the same k2. However, by normalizing k2, we see that k2 are actually different between samples. So, before making any statistical comparisons of k2, make sure that the k2 you're comparing had been normalized. The formulas in German et al 2011 give you normalized enzyme activities, so if you use these formulas, plot them against substrate concentrations, and perform a nonlinear regression, the k2 you're getting out is **normalized** k2. Note: substrate and enzyme concentrations and Michaelis-Menten constant are not normalized in these plots, so these values are similar across samples.

Now, onto the right column. As stated in the above section, by normalizing both enzyme activity and substrate concentrations and plotting them against each other, you have the effect of normalizing (1) substrate concentrations, (2) enzyme concentration, and (3) the Michaelis-Menten constant and then using these normalized values to calculate normalized enzyme activity. If you only look at the left column, you would think that all 3 samples have the same enzyme concentration and Km. However, once you normalized enzyme concentration & Km and use them (along with normalized substrate concentrations) to calculate and plot normalized enzyme activity, you would see that they all have very different normalized enzyme activities, stemming from different normalized enzyme concentration & Km. Normalizing them reveal differences that you would not see if you don't normalize. So, before comparing enzyme concentrations & Km, please normalize them. If you use formulas from German et al 2011 to calculate normalized enzyme activity and then plot that against substrate concentration, you will produce un-normalized Km and enzyme concentrations. Normalize these values first, and then you can make statistical comparisons.

# Conclusion
Normalize -- or make sure that you're using normalized values -- k2, Km, and enzyme concentrations first before making statistical comparisons. By not normalizing them, you can risk losing track of actual differences, resulting in higher probabilities of false negatives (Type II error).
