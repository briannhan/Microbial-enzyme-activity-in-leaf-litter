# On normalizing enzyme activity
After producing these 2 figures, I've concluded that when I'm comparing k2, concentration of enzymes, and Km, I should first normalize all 3 of them before conducting any statistical comparisons. Normalizing, in this case, means dividing these 3 quantities by the litter mass.

## Normalizing 1 sample
Let's examine the figure where I normalize only 1 sample. I set the same axis limits for all the plots in this figure. The top middle plot is the one where I normalized enzyme activity and plotted that versus substrate concentration. The top right plot is the one where I normalized k2 and used this normalized k2 to calculate new enzyme activity. As you can see, these plots look identical in shape. So, you can conclude that by plotting normalized enzyme activity vs substrate concentration, that has the effect of normalizing k2 first and then using this normalized k2 to calculate enzyme activity. While k2 normally has units of s^-1 or other inverse units of time, by normalizing k2, this new k2 has units of s^-1 g^-1. So the "k2" in the top middle and top right plots is ***normalized*** k2. The substrate and enzyme concentrations and the Michaelis-Menten constant are not normalized.

Now, onto the plots at the bottom of the same figure. Bottom left (Kiara reference, anyone?) plot is made by normalizing both enzyme activity and substrate concentration and then plotting that against each other. Bottom middle plot is made by normalizing (1) substrate concentrations, (2) enzyme concentration, and (3) the Michaelis-Menten constant and then using these normalized values to calculate normalized enzyme activity. k2 is not normalized. As you can see, both of these 2 plots are identical. By plotting normalizing both enzyme activity and substrate concentrations and plotting them against each other, you have the effect of normalizing the above 3 values and using them to calculate the normalized enzyme activity.

Now, I would like to note that whether I normalize (1) k2 or (2) substrate & enzyme concentrations and the Michaelis-Menten constant, I still produce the same normalized enzyme activity rates. To see if this is true, I plotted normalized enzyme activity calculated by normalizing k2 against normalized enzyme activity calculated by normalizing (1) substrate concentrations, (2) enzyme concentration, and (3) the Michaelis-Menten constant in the bottom right plot. As you can see it's a perfect correlation. They are identical. However, normalizing one or the other results in different substrate concentrations, which would lengthen or shorten either of the other curves.

## Normalizing 3 samples
Now, let's examine the figure where I normalize 3 samples. Each row in the figure represents a different sample, with sample 1 (top row) having the highest litter mass and sample 3 (bottom row) having the lowest litter mass. The left column are plots of their total enzyme activity; the middle column consist of plots of their normalized enzyme activity vs substrate concentration; the right column consists of plots of normalized enzyme activity vs normalized substrate concentrations. I made it so that all 3 samples have identical **total** enzyme activity, but because their litter masses are different, they will end up with different **normalized** enzyme activity. Because their **total** enzyme activities are identical, they all have identical (1) k2, (2) enzyme concentration, and (3) Michaelis-Menten constants. Conversely, because their **normalized** enzyme activities are different, their normalized versions of (1) k2, (2) enzyme concentrations, and (3) Michaelis-Menten constants will be different between samples.

As stated in the above section, by plotting normalized enzyme activity vs substrate concentration, you have the effect of first normalizing k2 and then using that normalized k2 to calculate enzyme activity. If you look in the middle column, notice how, as you go down the column, normalized enzyme activities tend to increase. That is because litter mass decreases as you go down the column. So, you can conclude that **normalized** k2 tends to increase as you go down. The formulas in German et al 2011 give you normalized enzyme activities, so if you use these formulas, plot them against substrate concentrations, and perform a nonlinear regression, the k2 you're getting out is **normalized** k2. Note: substrate and enzyme concentrations and Michaelis-Menten constant are not normalized in these plots, so these values are similar across samples.

Now, onto the right column. As stated in the above section, by normalizing both enzyme activity and substrate concentrations and plotting them against each other, you have the effect of normalizing (1) substrate concentrations, (2) enzyme concentration, and (3) the Michaelis-Menten constant and then using these normalized values to calculate normalized enzyme activity. If you only look at the left column, you would think that all 3 samples have the same enzyme concentration and Km. However, once you normalized enzyme concentration & Km and use them (along with normalized substrate concentrations) to calculate and plot normalized enzyme activity, you would see that they all have very different normalized enzyme activities, stemming from different normalized enzyme concentration & Km. Normalizing them reveal differences that you would not see if you don't normalize. If you use formulas from German et al 2011 to calculate normalized enzyme activity and then plot that against substrate concentration, you will produce un-normalized Km and enzyme concentrations.

## Discussion
Aight, now that I've described the figure where I normalized 3 samples, let's discuss it a bit more. I used 3 different hypothetical litter samples, and all of them have the same (non-normalized) k2, Km, and enzyme concentration. However, all of them have different litter masses. So what differentiates all these litter samples from each other? Each of them require a different amount of litter to reach the same enzyme concentration. So, they all have different normalized enzyme concentrations. That's about the only difference.

If you normalize k2 and Km, you would see that their normalized k2 & Km are different from each other. However, are they actually different from each other, or are these differences actually caused by different normalized enzyme concentrations?

After thinking about this for a little bit, I think that it's weird to normalize k2 & Km before doing statistical comparisons. After all, as the left column of the 3-samples figure shows, they all have the same non-normalized k2 & Km. They just require a different amount of litter to achieve the same enzyme concentration. So any differences are due to normalized enzyme concentrations. Non-normalized k2 & Km between all these litter samples are identical, so the kinetic properties are actually identical. Just that it takes different amounts of litter to reach the same amount of enzymes. So I should be making statistical comparisons between **non-normalized** k2 & Km and **normalized** enzyme concentrations.
