1. Figures
2. How to interpret litter chemistry
	1. Ashish: FTIR data can be interpreted according to specific functional groups, not so much compounds e.g. cellulose, hemicellulose
	2. How should the prevalence of functional groups be interpreted against CAZyme gene data and enzyme data, which are specific to litter compounds?
	
3. Sudden jump in total CAZyme domains in grassland starting at time point 2. Not sure how to interpret that

# Overall story of the paper
Currently writing 2nd draft
## Introduction
- Focusing more tightly on litter decomposition
- Described Y-A-S framework
- Discussed litter chemistry changes under drought
- Variation in microbial responses depending on the ecosystem
- Changed conceptual framework, with the goal of having the paper be about how drought + drought-induced litter chemistry changes affect resource acquisition traits (measured by CAZyme gene proportions + enzyme Vmax)

## Discussion
- No direct drought effects on enzyme Vmax
	+ Enzyme Vmax dependent on fungal biomass and composition, which are more resistant to drought than bacterial biomass and composition
	+ Nutrient availability and demand might be bigger factors than drought, as shown by how grassland litter has higher NAG activity -> higher N mineralization rates from chitin -> higher enzyme activity in grassland litter than CSS litter
	+ Enzyme Vmax doesn't decrease to maintain nutrient availability for production of osmolytes & EPSs
		* Should we only apply this explanation to grass microbes rather than CSS microbes, since only grass microbes showed other physiological changes over the 3-month period in Malik et al 2020?
- No drought-induced litter chemistry effects on enzyme Vmax
	+ Increased protein concentrations in litter but no change in protease activity
		* Proposed mechanism: proteins are still protected light-harvesting complex II of chloroplasts, and these complexes are not broken down
		* Alternatively, I can just say that while soil protein content and soil protease activity are positively coupled, this relationship does not necessarily hold true for leaf litter protein and leaf litter protease
	+ Enzyme activity is partially constitutive, and litter chemistry changes aren't enough to induce changes
		* Microbial origin effect from Alster et al 2013 > litter origin effect
- Drought has differential effects on cellulose CAZyme gene proportion depending on the ecosystem, but these differential effects attenuate with time
	+ Consistent with various studies showing attenuating responses to changes in climate, including drought
	


Ashish's comments during meeting
- Change time in ANOVA to a random factor
- Main story: negative result, no change due to changes in precipitation
- 1 example of data analysis from Ashish: mixed linear model with prec, veg, prec x veg, and time as a random factor
- Redo statistics, he wants me to remove time as an effect
- Ashish might incorporate mass loss into this paper as well, maybe
- Ashish also has a new dataset for %reads instead of CAZyme%
- Microbes might already be adapted to drought, that's one idea we can mention
- Ashish, with his mass loss, sees a slight separation with time in grass between drought and ambient precipitation, wants to argue that changes in litter chemistry will affect mass loss


Action items:
- Brian
	+ Send Ashish enzyme Vmax data and FTIR data
		* Ashish was the one who originally sent me the FTIR data but he wants me to send it again just to ensure that we both have the same data
	+ Do linear mixed effect models for enzyme Vmax and FTIR data
		* Ashish suggested combining enzyme Vmax together into C-degrading vs N-degrading enzymes, just straight up summing them
		* Do linear mixed effect models for enzyme Vmax separately first, then think about combining them and do linear mixed effect models again
	+ Organize meeting to talk about the points in the paper
- Ashish
	+ Send Brian figures on 3 datasets: Vmax, FTIR, CAZyme genes
	+ Send Brian new CAZyme gene dataset for Brian to do linear mixed effect models
