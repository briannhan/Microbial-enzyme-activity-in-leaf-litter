This is an agenda for the meeting with Ashish

1. Discuss how to define functional redundancy vs functional similarity
   1. Ask him if having CAZyme relative abundance means more species with a specific function, and if yes, then does that equate to functional redundancy
2. Discuss his hypothesis of amide1 litter chemistry data vs my hypotheses of amide1 litter chemistry data
   1. His hypothesis: amide1 increases because of microbes growing over time, creating proteins
      1. If we go with this hypothesis, then we also need to show his microbial biomass data that he analyzed himself and didn't have me analyze, that means adding a new dataset
   2. My hypotheses
      1. Hypothesis 1: proteins are actually from leaves and just accumulate because microbes aren't using them
      2. Back up hypothesis 1 with amide1 precipitation treatments data
      3. Hypothesis 2 (which concerns amide1 precipitation treatments data): N is remobilized at lower rates under drought, explaining the higher N content under drought
         1. Mention that I've found studies that show increased N in leaf litter and decreased N remobilization under drought
3. The framework that Steve proposes
   1. I feel like our data doesn't back up that framework very well. The litter chemistry -> genes (CAZyme domains) link can only be supported by the hemicellulose (litter chemistry & CAZymes) data, while the genes (CAZyme domains) -> enzyme Vmax link cannot be supported by neither the hemicellulose nor cellulose or lignin data, and the litter chemistry -> enzyme Vmax link is supported by cellulose data but it's missing the litter chemistry -> genes (CAZyme domains) link
   2. Is it ok to assume that relationships in the framework are directly proportional i.e. higher hemicellulose in litter chemistry = higher hemicellulose CAZyme domains = higher BX amounts?
   3. Perhaps I can discuss substrate preference instead? As in higher hemicellulose amounts = higher hemicellulose CAZyme domains, and higher cellulose amounts = higher cellulase amounts (BG & CBH)
   4. Higher hemicellulose CAZyme domains in grass may be due to either increased speciation or increased dispersal bringing new microbes into grass

## Topics I might put in discussion section of manuscript

1. Proposed new mechanism for why drought does not affect enzyme activity: lack of change in enzyme turnover & enzyme production
2. Proteins in litter chemistry, suggesting accumulation of leaf litter proteins & N yet that doesn't increase either protease or other enzyme amounts
   1. Discuss a possible decrease in remobilization of leaf N
   2. Discuss how these observations contrast with other studies that show that enzyme activity increases with N addition in soil
3. The lack of an effect of drought on enzyme activity implies that other constraints, stoichiometry constraints, might control enzyme activity
   1. Discuss how NAG amounts data indicates that microbes in these 2 ecosystems might be more reliant on microbial necromass as a N source to fuel enzyme production
      1. Cite a lit review that showed that microbial C:N decreases under drought
      2. This possibly explains why PPO amounts are higher in grass
4. The framework?
5. Microbes in this ecosystem are resistant to changes, enzyme vmax don't change that much, neither does CAZyme abundance
6. No need to talk about diversity increasing due to fungal abundance, I haven't brought up dispersal yet
