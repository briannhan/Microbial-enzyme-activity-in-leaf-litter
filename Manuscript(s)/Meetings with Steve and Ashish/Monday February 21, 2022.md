Purpose: discuss data analysis tasks with Ashish

Topics to talk about include

1. Reconciling my analysis of enzyme activity with his
2. Using his mass loss & microbial biomass data
3. Discussing data analysis tasks with him

## Reconciling my analysis of enzyme activity with his

Our analyses reveal similar results with the exception of BX, in which he found a significant vegetation effect while I found none. I went over his code and thoroughly described the differences between the steps he and I took in our individual analyses in an email to him and Steve.

He agreed to make plots using my Vmax values. We'll see what he has to say once he made the plots, though, because there is a bit of a difference between our individual analyses. For example, it looks like, to him, that LAP activity increases over time in grass, which makes sense due to microbes releasing all these extracellular enzymes. Meanwhile, I didn't find any influence of time point, vegetation, or precipitation on LAP activity. And he saw that BX was high initially, which, in his opinion, correlates with how there must be higher carbohydrates and leaf litter decrease in carbohydrates.

## Using his mass loss & microbial biomass data

I'm thinking of seeing how differences in enzyme pool sizes affect decomposition rates, and whether microbial biomass correlates with enzyme pool sizes. My one concern with this is, he already seems to be using these data in a paper that he is preparing that he cited in his Microbial Genomics seminar.

Things to ask him about:

1. Asks if he's already doing this in his paper that I'm not a part of
2. Ask what his other paper is focusing on.

Guess we won't be using these data

## Discussing data analysis tasks with him

This is what he originally suggested the meeting for. The tasks are split as follows

Me:

1. Send Ashish unstransformed and log-10 transformed Vmax values that I calculated
2. Conduct statistical analysis on CAZyme and FTIR data after Ashish sends me the data structures
3. Write introduction, results, and discussion with Steve

Ashish:

1. Make all figures, including additional figures from my calculated Vmax values, incorporating my statistical analysis wherever needed
2. Send me the data structure for FTIR and CAZyme, and get back to me on how to read the y-axis of the CAZyme figures he has so far

## Other notes

He said that carbohydrates glycosidic bonds that showed in FTIR, are indicative of cellulose.
