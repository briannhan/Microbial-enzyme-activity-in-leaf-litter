# Meeting 1 discussion notes

Date & time of meeting: Monday January 31, 2022 8 AM PST - 8:50 AM PST

Ashish and Steve didn't like my box model because of a couple of reasons. They think that enzymes in leaf litter are not as influenced by adsorption/desorption, and that that's more of a soil thing. Steve also says that there are enzymes that adsorb onto leaf litter because that's their whole shtick. Also, Ashish mentioned at one point that enzyme activity are a phenotypic expression of microbial genomes, so enzyme activity in leaf litter aren't influenced by abiotic factors such as adsorption/desorption. He did acknowledge that adsorption/desorption of enzymes are a thing in soil, though, but not in leaf litter, as the point of leaf litter is to circumvent this sort of stuff.

As for the special edition of the Microbiology journal that Ashish brought up, seems like if we say that we will have a really good paper coming up, then we can push the deadline back (Ashish said that we can potentially push it back by 1/2 months, Steve says that maybe we can push it back to June). But at the same time, they're all fine with doing a different journal altogether.

The datasets mentioned are enzyme activity, leaf litter chemistry, CAZyme counts, and mass loss. Ashish will essentially look at all carbohydrates combined, while I can parse them out into individual substrates. In addition, Ashish will look at the following scales: population, community, and ecosystem. I can look at things from a biogeochemistry point of view using mass loss.

## Roles

Ashish already done a lot of the analyses. We can even recycle some of the figures that he made.

Since me and Steve are in the same time zone, we can work on the writing together.

All of this results in Steve suggesting that I can be first author and Ashish can be last author

Steve said that maybe I can redo some of the analyses. My only concern with doing so, is redoing work that Ashish already had done might be a little insulting to Ashish. Ashish did mention that I can do the analyses on my own time to gain some more data analysis skills.

## Next steps

So now I'm just waiting for Ashish to send over the CAZymes data and mass loss data. Then I can familiarize myself with the data and the figures that Ashish had made to interpret the data. I can also watch the talk that Ashish sent which I bookmarked on my browser.

My concern is, if any of the stuff that I myself will be doing will be redoing work that Ashish had already done. For example, if I redo some of his analyses to remake some of the figures, then that might be a little insulting to him. Will need to talk to Steve about this.
