# Microbial enzyme activity in leaf litter
The Loma Ridge Global Change Experiment is an experiment that studies how climate change affects carbon cycle feedbacks. It is ran by Steve Allison, a professor of the ESS and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology deparments at UCI who specializes in microbial ecology and decomposition as a component of the carbon cycle. This project specifically studies the enzymes of microbes that decompose leaf litter by analyzing leaf litter chemistry, extracellular enzyme activity, and the abundance of CAZyme genes. Comparisons will be made between coastal sage scrub vs grass vegetation and reduced vs ambient precipitation.
