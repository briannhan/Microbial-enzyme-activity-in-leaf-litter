# Hypotheses
Aight so let's discuss what I want to test, and what independent variables are there. I'm going to use Michaelis-Menten parameters (Vmax & Km). I will frame this study according to the following questions:
1. How does enzyme **activity** change as a result of changes in enzyme **concentrations**?
2. How does litter chemistry influence enzyme activity under ambient precipitation?
3. How does drought and litter chemistry interact to affect enzyme activity?

Each of these questions will be answered by at least 1 hypothesis. Each hypothesis will produce at least 1 prediction.

In addition, there is some background needed to interpret the Michaelis-Menten parameters. Vmax will be used as a measure of the amount of enzymes present (Baker & Allison, 2013; Wallenstein & Weintraub, 2008); while Vmax is not a direct measurement of enzyme concentrations, reaction velocity theoretically maxes out when there are abundant substrates and so the only limiting factor is the amount of enzymes present (Wallenstein & Weintraub, 2008). Apparent Km, obtained from nonlinear regression, is used as a measure of product concentrations and substrate concentrations, where higher values of Km are indicative of higher product concentrations and lower substrate concentrations (Baker & Allison, 2013; Chrost, 1990; Chrost, 1992). This comes from the hypothesis that reaction products serve as competitive inhibitors, which does not affect Vmax but does increase apparent Km. Chrost 1990 found that reaction products increase apparent Km of beta-glucosidase in aquatic samples, while Chrost 1992 found that reaction products of leucine aminopeptidase tend to correlate with Km, lending more support to the hypothesis that reaction products serve as competitive inhibitors. Likewise, Baker & Allison 2013 found that the amount of crude proteins in litter from subalpine and alpine ecosystems in California are low while the Km of leucine aminopeptidase from these ecosystems are high, suggesting that crude proteins have been largely decomposed by leucine aminopeptidase, producing high concentrations of reaction products that increase the apparent Km of leucine aminopeptidase.

## Question 1: How does enzyme activity change as a result of decreases in enzyme concentrations?
Hypothesis 1: Acclimation will occur so that enzyme activity remains constant.
Prediction 1: As enzyme concentrations change (which changes Vmax), so will Km so that enzyme activity remains constant. Therefore, if Vmax decrease, then Km decreases to prevent a decrease in enzyme activity.

## Question 2: How does litter chemistry influence enzyme activity under ambient precipitation?
This question is answered by 2 complementary hypotheses. These hypotheses do not contradict each other, with the second one serving as an exception to cases not described by the first one.
Hypothesis 2a: Activity of a particular enzyme increases when exposed to litter with a higher proportion of its target substrate.
Prediction 2a: When exposed to litter with a higher proportion of a specific substrate compared to litter with a lower proportion, the enzyme that is specific to that substrate will increase in concentration (indicated by increases in Vmax).
Hypothesis 2b: Lignin is a noncompetitive inhibitor of hydrolytic enzymes with high lignin proportions serving as a cost to hydrolytic enzyme activity.
Prediction 2b: Litter with high lignin proportion will see an increase in concentrations of oxidative enzyme concentrations while hydrolytic enzyme activity will decrease. Noncompetitive inhibition entails the binding of an inhibitor to an enzyme and removing the enzyme from the reaction. Therefore, decreases in hydrolytic enzyme activity is caused by a decreased in concentrations of hydrolytic enzymes (which decreases Vmax of hydrolytic enzymes). If hypothesis 1 is true, then Km of hydrolytic enzymes in high-lignin litter will also decrease to offset any decreases in activity from decreasing Vmax.

## Question 3: How does drought and litter chemistry interact to affect enzyme activity?
Hypothesis 3a: Following the Y-A-S framework, there is a clear tradeoff in energy, carbon, and other nutrients spent between resource acquisition traits and stress tolerance traits when microbes are in environments with high resources.
Prediction 3a: This tradeoff means that in low-lignin, high-resources litter that is under drought, enzyme concentrations will decrease (shown by a decrease in Vmax) due to a shift in resources from production of enzymes (a resource acquisition trait) to stress tolerance.
Hypothesis 4a: Microbial enzyme production in high-lignin, low-resources litter is primarily constitutive and, therefore, unchangable.
Prediction 4a: Enzyme concentrations in high-lignin, low-resources litter will be the same (no significant changes in Vmax) regardless of changes in precipitation.
