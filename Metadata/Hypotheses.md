# Hypotheses
Aight so let's discuss what I want to test, and what independent variables are there. I'm going to use the Equilibrium Chemistry Approximation to obtain enzyme kinetic parameters (k2 & Km) as well as enzyme concentrations. I will frame this study according to the following questions:
1. How does enzyme **activity** change as a result of changes in enzyme **concentrations**?
2. How does litter chemistry influence enzyme activity under ambient precipitation?
3. How does drought and litter chemistry interact to affect enzyme activity?

Each of these questions will be answered by at least 1 hypothesis. Each hypothesis will produce at least 1 prediction.

## Question 1: How does enzyme activity change as a result of decreases in enzyme concentrations?
Hypothesis 1: Acclimation will occur so that enzyme activity remains constant.
Prediction 1: As enzyme concentrations change, so will k2 and Km so that enzyme activity remains constant. Therefore, if enzyme concentrations decrease, then k2 will increase and/or Km decreases to prevent a decrease in enzyme activity.

## Question 2: How does litter chemistry influence enzyme activity under ambient precipitation?
This question is answered by 2 complementary hypotheses. These hypotheses do not contradict each other, with the second one serving as an exception to cases not described by the first one.
Hypothesis 2a: Activity of a particular enzyme increases when exposed to litter with a higher proportion of its target substrate.
Prediction 2a: When exposed to litter with a higher proportion of a specific substrate compared to litter with a lower proportion, the enzyme that is specific to that substrate will increase in concentration.
Hypothesis 2b: Lignin is a noncompetitive inhibitor of hydrolytic enzymes with high lignin proportions serving as a cost to hydrolytic enzyme activity.
Prediction 2b: Litter with high lignin proportion will see an increase in concentrations of oxidative enzyme concentrations while hydrolytic enzyme activity will decrease. Noncompetitive inhibition entails the binding of an inhibitor to an enzyme and removing the enzyme from the reaction. Therefore, decreases in hydrolytic enzyme activity is caused by a decreased in concentrations of hydrolytic enzymes. If hypothesis 1 is true, then Km of hydrolytic enzymes in high-lignin litter will decrease to offset any decreases in activity from decreasing concentrations of hydrolytic enzymes.

## Question 3: How does drought and litter chemistry interact to affect enzyme activity?
Hypothesis 3a: Following the Y-A-S framework, there is a clear tradeoff in energy, carbon, and other nutrients spent between resource acquisition traits and stress tolerance traits when microbes are in environments with high resources.
Prediction 3a: This tradeoff means that in low-lignin, high-resources litter that is under drought, enzyme concentrations will decrease due to a shift in resources from production of enzymes (a resource acquisition trait) to stress tolerance.
Hypothesis 4a: Microbial enzyme production in high-lignin, low-resources litter is primarily constitutive and, therefore, unchangable.
Prediction 4a: Enzyme concentrations in high-lignin, low-resources litter will be the same regardless of changes in precipitation.
