## Data description
The dry weight of each sample is obtained, which is then used to calculate enzyme activities for that particular sample. The dry weight data of litter samples are in the “Litter dry weights” folder. In that folder, there are 2 Excel files: a file from a previous postdoc that contains the dry weight data of all timepoints (2020-11-10-Dry-weight.xlsx) while another one containing the reworked dry weight data of timepoint T6 (2020-11-10-weight-t6.xlsx). To use dry weight data for the T6 timepoint, please use “Sheet 1” of the latter file, not the file from the postdoc; the envelope weights for timepoint T6 in the postdoc’s file are likely to be incorrect.

The file from the postdoc also doubles as an association metadata file that contains the month and year (YY) of each timepoint (when litterbags were picked up from the research site).


## Units
The data files only contain mass data, the units of which are in grams.


## Association metadata file
**2020-11-10-Dry-weight.xlsx**: this file describes the month and year (YY) of each time point in which litterbags were picked up from the field.
